# 🃏 Push_swap - The Art of Sorting with Fewer Moves

Welcome to Push_swap, the ultimate challenge in sorting small stacks with big brain moves! 🧠✨
### 📌 What is Push_swap?

Push_swap is a coding challenge where you take a bunch of numbers (in stack A) and sort them in ascending order using only two stacks (A and B) and a limited set of operations. Sounds easy? Think again! The goal is not just to sort but to do it in the least number of moves possible.
### 🎯 The Challenge

You'll have to master these operations like a sorting ninja:

🔄 sa, sb, ss – Swap the top two elements

📤 pa, pb – Push elements between stacks
 
🔃 ra, rb, rr – Rotate stacks up

🔄 rra, rrb, rrr – Rotate stacks down

Sounds simple, right? Well, when the stack size increases, things get tricky. Optimization is key! 🏆
### 🛠️ How It Works

- Take a list of numbers as arguments.
- Apply sorting algorithms (simple sort, quicksort, radix, or your own magic).
- Output the most efficient sequence of operations to sort them.

### 💡 Why Push_swap?

- You’ll learn algorithm optimization.
- You’ll improve problem-solving skills.
- You’ll cry a little but get smarter.
